# tiktok-dl
A simple tiktok bulk videos downloader written in Python. You can download all videos at once of a tiktok user using this script.

# Note
<a href="https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api">Unofficial TikTok API</a> seems like having issue even with custom_verifyFp option. Until it is fixed, Use <b>tiktok-auto.py</b> to download videos.

``python -m playwright install``
  
# Usages
  ``python tiktok.py``
